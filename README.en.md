TelePress publishes Markdown, plain text, images, and ZIP galleries to
[Telegraph](https://telegra.ph). It supports automatic pagination, external
image hosts, image compression, concurrent uploads, and an optional REST API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A Telegraph token, or permission to create one on first use
- An image-host configuration only when publishing images or galleries

## Installation

```bash
pip install telepress

# Optional REST API
pip install "telepress[api]"

# Optional S3-compatible hosts such as AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2
pip install "telepress[s3]"

# Optional YAML configuration files
pip install "telepress[yaml]"
```

Install from source for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redtidev1918/telepress.git
cd telepress
python -m pip install --editable ".[dev]"
```

## Quick start

Publish a document:

```bash
telepress article.md --title "My post"

# The explicit subcommand is equivalent
telepress publish article.md --title "My post"
```

Publish an image or ZIP gallery after configuring an image host:

```bash
telepress configure
telepress check
telepress photo.jpg --title "Photo"
telepress gallery.zip --title "Gallery"
```

Useful publishing options:

```bash
# Override the configured image limit in MiB
telepress gallery.zip --image-size-limit 10

# Keep original images instead of compressing oversized files
telepress gallery.zip --no-compress

# Use a Telegraph-compatible API endpoint
telepress article.md --api-url http://localhost:9009
```

Text-only publishing does not load or require an image-host configuration.
The Telegraph access token is created automatically when needed and stored in
`~/.telegraph_token` unless one is supplied with `--token`.

## REST API

Install the optional API dependencies first: `pip install "telepress[api]"`.

```bash
telepress-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Interactive OpenAPI documentation is available at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/publish/text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"# Title\n\nBody","title":"Example"}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/publish/file \
  -F "file=@article.md" \
  -F "title=Example"

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/publish/gallery \
  -F "files=@p0.jpg" \
  -F "files=@p1.jpg" \
  -F "title=Gallery title" \
  -F "tags=pixiv, illustration" \
  -F "link=https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/123456" \
  -F "spoiler=true"
```

`/publish/gallery` accepts repeated `files` parts plus optional `title`,
`tags` (comma-separated), `link` (source URL) and `spoiler` (truthy for R-18
content) form fields. Files are packed into a zip in upload order and
published with automatic pagination and Prev/Next navigation; `tags`, `link`
and the R-18 warning are rendered as a footer on the first page. It returns
`{"ok": true, "url": "...", "files": N}` and is compatible with generic
multipart delivery clients, e.g. PixivFlow `httpMultipart` targets pointing
at `http://<telepress-host>:8000/publish/gallery`.

Blocking file, compression, and network work is dispatched away from the API
event loop, so concurrent requests do not serialize on those operations.

## Image hosts

Supported hosts:

- ImgBB
- Imgur
- sm.ms
- Catbox (anonymous or userhash)
- S3-compatible storage, including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, OSS, and MinIO
- Rclone remotes
- Custom HTTP upload APIs

Run `telepress configure` for the interactive setup, or create
`~/.telepress.json`:

```json
{
  "image_host": {
    "type": "rclone",
    "remote_path": "myremote:bucket/path",
    "public_url": "https://cdn.example.com/path",
    "rclone_flags": ["--transfers=32", "--checkers=32"],
    "max_size_mb": 20,
    "max_workers": 8
  }
}
```

S3-compatible configuration:

```json
{
  "image_host": {
    "type": "s3",
    "access_key_id": "your-access-key",
    "secret_access_key": "your-secret-key",
    "bucket": "your-bucket",
    "public_url": "https://cdn.example.com",
    "endpoint_url": "https://s3.example.com",
    "region_name": "auto"
  }
}
```

Catbox configuration (anonymous upload works without `userhash`):

```bash
# Anonymous upload
export TELEPRESS_IMAGE_HOST_TYPE=catbox

# Use your account userhash (to manage/anonymize files)
export TELEPRESS_IMAGE_HOST_TYPE=catbox
export TELEPRESS_IMAGE_HOST_USERHASH=YOUR_USERHASH
```

```json
{
  "image_host": {
    "type": "catbox",
    "userhash": "YOUR_USERHASH"
  }
}
```

Catbox does not recompress files itself. When uploading images through
`ImageUploader`, TelePress still compresses over `max_size` first; calling
`CatboxHost.upload(path)` directly uploads the file as-is (ZIP, TXT and
other plain files are accepted). Anonymous uploads are not tied to an account
and cannot be managed or deleted from Catbox's web interface, so do not use
them for long-term storage of important files.

Environment variables override file configuration:

```bash
export TELEPRESS_IMAGE_HOST_TYPE=imgbb
export TELEPRESS_IMAGE_HOST_API_KEY=your-key
```

Configuration is searched in the following locations:

1. The path passed to `load_config()`
2. `TELEPRESS_CONFIG`
3. `~/.telepress.json`, `~/.telepress.yaml`, `~/.telepress.yml`
4. `~/.config/telepress.json`

## Python API

```python
from telepress import TelegraphPublisher, publish, publish_text

url = publish("article.md", title="My article")
text_url = publish_text("# Hello\n\nWorld", title="Hello")

publisher = TelegraphPublisher(image_size_limit=10)
gallery_url = publisher.publish("gallery.zip", title="Gallery")
```

Upload images directly:

```python
from telepress import ImageUploader

uploader = ImageUploader("imgbb", api_key="your-key")
url = uploader.upload("photo.jpg")

batch = uploader.upload_batch(["1.jpg", "2.jpg"])
print(batch.success_rate, batch.get_url_map())
```

## Behavior and limits

- Markdown and plain text are converted to Telegraph DOM nodes.
- Plain text chapter headings such as `Chapter 1` and `第一章` are detected.
- Large text is split near 10,000-character boundaries and linked with
  previous/next navigation.
- Galleries are split at 100 images per page.
- Images larger than 5 MiB are compressed by default; GIF compression is
  intentionally skipped.
- A 2 GiB input safety limit is applied before processing.
- Duplicate text publications are cached in `~/.telepress_cache.json` by
  default.

Supported input extensions include `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.rst`,
`.text`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, and `.zip`.

## Error handling

```python
from telepress import TelePressError, ValidationError, publish

try:
    url = publish("article.md")
except ValidationError as exc:
    print(f"Invalid input: {exc}")
except TelePressError as exc:
    print(f"Publishing failed: {exc}")
```
